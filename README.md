**************************** this is a project in progress (this is for educational purposes) ****************************

# A- Artinep.github.io
This is an Automated Market Makers for exchanging cryptocurrency, trading cryptocurrency and generating passive income. It is absolutely free for everyone.
This is for educational purposes but blockchain is real (mainnet).

# B- How it works:
Based on ethereum smart contract.
This page connects you straight to the smart contract, you don't use any kind of server, everything you do is directly connected to the blockchain by your own node or node provider.

### B-1- WHAT is it?:
Trade, swapp, transfert, withdraw on ethereum network or other ethereum node.

### B-2- REAL Transparency and FEE:
You can see everything you do through the page or an Ethereum Explorer. The smart contract takes a small fee for each transfer, but you decide how much that fee is.
How fast your transfer is depends on the amount of fee you've put on it.
How to know the right fee? They'll be displayed on the page as large, medium, and small. You've got the option to set the value as needed.

### B-3- CONTROL:
It's written on a global register, so basically everyone's already controlling it.
If you're paranoid or psychopathic, you can rest assured that the people who create nuclear weapons aren't going to use this page. They have their generals, submarines, and logistics for trafficking.
We do take action, but only when it's absolutely necessary: We're going to verify the account reported by so many people as belonging to an axxhole, then we'll freeze it from the smart contract.

### B-4- Liquidity Providers (pool):
Anybody can become a liquidity provider and earn a share of the pie on each contract transfer. transfers and earnings are displayed in full transparency on the page.

# C- Terms of Use:
Please read github terms of service [here](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service).
